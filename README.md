# Fractal-Based Encryption System

## 🔐 Introduction

This project introduces a novel encryption system based on fractal mathematics. Unlike traditional cryptographic systems (RSA, AES, etc.), this method utilizes **fractals and non-continuous functions** (e.g., power tower functions) to generate highly sensitive encryption keys. The encryption is based on coordinates (x, y) in a fractal function, where even a **0.001% difference in coordinates results in a completely different output**, making brute-force attacks infeasible.

## 📌 Features

- **Fractal-Based Encryption**: Uses fractal functions instead of traditional cryptographic algorithms.
- **Extreme Sensitivity**: Tiny coordinate changes (0.001%) lead to completely different encryption results.
- **Quantum-Resistant**: Non-linear transformations make it difficult for quantum computers to break.
- **Open Source**: Freely available for security researchers and developers.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Select a **non-continuous fractal function** (e.g., power tower function).
2. Choose a precise coordinate **(x, y)** in the fractal function.
3. The value at (x, y) is used to **encrypt the secret message**.
4. Only users with the exact coordinate can **decrypt** the message.

### 🔸 Example Encryption Process

```python
secret_number = 42
x, y = 1.0, 1.0  # Precise coordinates

# Encrypt using fractal-based function
encrypted_value = encrypt_with_power_tower(secret_number, x, y)

# Decrypt only if exact coordinates are known
decrypted_value = decrypt_with_power_tower(encrypted_value, x, y)
```

## 🔍 Why This Matters

- **Brute Force Attacks Are Impossible**: Since the coordinate space is continuous, trying all possible (x, y) pairs is computationally infeasible.
- **Quantum Computers Won’t Break It**: Unlike RSA which relies on integer factorization, this encryption is based on chaotic fractal behavior.
- **New Paradigm for Cryptography**: This approach introduces a novel field of research in non-continuous function-based encryption.
